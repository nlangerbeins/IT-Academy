                We source and roast coffee from single farms, estates and cooperatives. When we taste a coffee that we like, we want to know where it comes from and who grows, picks and processes it. We travel extensively throughout the year, visiting the producers and cooperatives with whom we currently work and looking for interesting varietals of coffee and new farms from which to buy.

                Coffee is a seasonal product with one or in some countries two crops a year. We buy small lots from many farms in each country – so when one coffee runs out, we go right on to the next one we have bought. In some places the farms are very small, just one or two acres, and these coffees change more frequently.
